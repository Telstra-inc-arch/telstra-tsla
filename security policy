# Security Policy

The Telstra‑tsla team takes the security of our users, customers, and ecosystem seriously. We appreciate coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities and strive to resolve confirmed issues quickly and transparently.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

**Notes**
- Only the branches listed above receive security fixes.
- End‑of‑life (EOL) branches are not patched; please upgrade to a supported line.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure and request that you **do not** publicly disclose a vulnerability before we’ve had a chance to investigate and release a fix.

### How to report
- **GitHub Security Advisory (preferred):**
  1. Open the target repository.
  2. Go to **Security → Report a vulnerability** and submit a private advisory.
- **Email (alternative):** `security@telstra-tsla.example`  
  - Optional PGP key: `https://telstra-tsla.example/pgp.txt` (key ID: `AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD`, fingerprint: `AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD EEEE FFFF 1111 2222 3333 4444`)

> If your report includes sensitive information (exploits, credentials, customer data), use the private GitHub advisory flow or encrypt your email with our PGP key.

### What to include
Please provide as much detail as possible to help us triage quickly:
- A clear description of the issue and **impact**.
- **Affected project/repository**, version(s), and environment.
- **Proof of concept** (PoC) or reproducible steps.
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots.
- Suggested remediation, if known.

## Our Process & Timelines

We follow these target service levels for valid reports:

1. **Triage acknowledgment:** within **2 business days**.  
2. **Initial assessment:** within **5 business days** (severity, scope, affected components).  
3. **Remediation plan:** shared within **10 business days** for High/Critical issues; within **20 business days** for Medium/Low.  
4. **Fix & release:**  
   - Critical/High: prioritized for the next patch release or hotfix.  
   - Medium/Low: batched into the next scheduled release.  
5. **Advisory publication:** we will publish a GitHub Security Advisory with CVE (when applicable) and upgrade/workaround guidance.

You will receive **weekly status updates** for open, confirmed issues until resolution. If a report is declined, we will explain the reasoning.

---

## Disclosure Policy

- We practice **coordinated disclosure**. We ask researchers to withhold public disclosure until a fix is available and users have had reasonable time to update.  
- If exploitation is detected in the wild, we may accelerate disclosure and release temporary mitigations.  
- We attribute credit to reporters who wish to be acknowledged in the advisory. If you prefer anonymity, tell us.

---

## Scope

**In scope**
- All actively maintained repositories under the **Telstra‑tsla** GitHub organization.
- Packages, images, and artifacts we publish from those repositories.

**Out of scope**
- Social engineering (phishing, vishing), physical security, or third‑party vendor platforms.
- Denial‑of‑Service (DoS) or volumetric attacks, including rate‑limit or resource exhaustion findings without demonstrable security impact.
- Automated scans reporting only low‑risk issues without proof of exploitability (e.g., missing security headers on non‑production demo environments).
- Vulnerabilities requiring a rooted/jailbroken device or non‑default, unsupported configurations.

If you’re unsure whether something is in scope, submit it; we’ll guide you.

---

## Severity & CVE

- We assess severity using **CVSS v3.1** and business impact.  
- For confirmed vulnerabilities affecting supported versions, we will request a **CVE ID** and publish a GitHub Security Advisory with remediation steps and fixed versions.

---

## Fix Distribution & Backports

- Security fixes are released as patch/minor versions on supported branches.  
- We backport fixes to all **Supported** lines in the table above when technically feasible and safe.  
- We do not patch EOL versions; upgrade guidance will be provided.

---

## Temporary Mitigations

When a complete fix is not immediately available, we may provide mitigations or configuration workarounds. These will be documented in the advisory and release notes.

---

## Safe Harbor

We will not initiate legal action against researchers who:
- Make a good‑faith effort to follow this policy,
- Avoid privacy violations, service disruption, and data destruction,
- Only access or expose data to the extent necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability,
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before any public disclosure.

If in doubt, contact us first.

---

## Bug Bounty

We do **not** currently offer monetary bounties. We recognize researchers in advisories (with consent) and may offer swag or thanks at our discretion.

---

## Contact & Updates

- Security contact: `security@telstra-tsla.example`  
- General contact: `oss@telstra-tsla.example`  
- Advisories & updates are posted in the **Security Advisories** section of each affected repository.

_Thank you for helping keep the Telstra‑tsla ecosystem safe for everyone._

Need edits (e.g., real email, PGP key, repo names)? Tell me the exact addresses and I’ll swap them in and tune the response timelines to your preference.
